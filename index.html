        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>
            If you have stumbled across my website, welcome! Hopefully you have found this website after I've been working on it for some time, and not during its early development stages
            (If you're reading this before March 2024, I am so sorry).
            This website is a project of mine that I started working on during academic leave with the goal of
            using it as a means to further familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
