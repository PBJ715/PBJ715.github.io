                <p>
                    My name is Jerry, and I am a second year Electrical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I am a programmer, computer enthusiast, and all around nerd. 
                    I am also quite passionate about problem solving, and like to work on projects (like this one) and solve LeetCode problems in my free time.
                    This portfolio website will be used as a medium to showcase projects that I am currently working on as well as previously completed projects. I hope you enjoy your time here!
